Global On‑Demand Stablecoin Protocol
A next‑generation framework for country‑specific over‑collateralized stablecoins ("sCoins"), enabling traditional financial institutions to capture domestic yield and execute near‑instant, low‑cost cross‑border payments. Designed as a reference document and roadmap, this guide collates all design decisions, technical building blocks, and operational considerations discussed in our brainstorming sessions.

1. Introduction & Vision
Global trade and treasury operations today rely heavily on a small set of dominant stablecoins (e.g., USDC, USDT) backed by U.S. short‑term securities. Institutions without direct trust or exposure to U.S. markets must accept inferior yields and incur multiple layers of FX and off‑ramp fees. Our protocol creates on‑demand, country‑specific stablecoins ("sINR", "sYEN", etc.) backed by over‑collateralized baskets of domestic assets—corporate and sovereign bonds, equities, gold—allowing participants to:
Capture domestic yields aligned to their risk appetite.


Simplify cross‑border payments by minting, transferring, burning, and re‑minting in destination currency with minimal friction.


Maintain peg integrity through over‑collateralization, dynamic fees, and an insurance vault.


Evolve into a global financial rail that could one day rival traditional fiat rails.

2. Problem Statement
Yield Concentration: Current stablecoins yield 3–5% by relying solely on U.S. government and agency debt, locking out institutions seeking local market exposure.


FX & Fee Overhead: Converting INR→USDT→JPY involves multiple spreads, taxation, and compliance costs, adding up to significant hidden fees.


Liquidity & Counterparty Risk: Existing rails depend on off‑ramp partners, hawala-like intermediaries, or deep pockets in U.S. markets, introducing opacity and trust demands.


Onboarding Complexity: Traditional cross‑border FX requires extensive knowledge, licensing, and banking relationships, limiting participation.


Our protocol abstracts these complexities: institutions deposit domestic assets; the system mints a pegged stablecoin; cross‑border settlement is a simple mint‑burn swap; collateral yields remain in local markets.

3. Core Concepts & Loopholes
3.1 Country‑Specific On‑Demand Stablecoins
sINR, sYEN, etc.: Each token is pegged 1:1 to its national fiat currency, but backed by a collateral basket of that jurisdiction’s assets.


Over‑Collateralization: Collateral value always exceeds outstanding token supply by a configurable ratio (e.g., 120%) to absorb market volatility and settlement timing mismatches.


3.2 Collateral Types & Eligibility
Tiered Assets:


Tier 1: Sovereign bonds (10–30 days to maturity).


Tier 2: Investment‑grade corporate debt (<= 6‑month tenor).


Tier 3: Equities, gold, other tokenizable assets.


Flexible Criteria: Institutions select baskets per risk tolerance; haircuts vary by tier (e.g., 5% for sovereign, 15% for corporates).


3.3 Mint/Burn Lifecycle
Mint: Institution deposits collateral off‑chain; custody attestation triggers on‑chain Oracle via Chainlink Functions; smart contract calculates NAV and issues sCoin.


Transfer: sCoin moves peer‑to‑peer or via standard token transfers/AMMs.


Burn: Recipient sends sCoin back; burn event triggers collateral release or underlying settlement.


3.4 Peg Stability & Incentives
Dynamic Fees: Adjustable mint/burn fees determined by liquidity stress or peg deviation metrics.


Arbitrage Incentives: Deep AMM pools and small spread fees encourage market makers to realign on‑chain price to off‑chain FX rates.


Insurance Vault: Premiums from stability fees accumulate in a protected pool; tapped only if collateral shortfalls arise.


3.5 Custody & Attestations
Permissioned Model: Banks and financial institutions onboarded via KYC; custody remains off‑chain with regulated trustees.


On‑Chain KYC Proofs: Institutions sign attestations stored on‑chain (akin to Story Protocol) to assert compliance without revealing sensitive data.


Periodic Audits: Monthly/quarterly custody attestations via Chainlink Functions to ensure NAV accuracy.



4. Technical Architecture
4.1 Collateral On‑Boarding & Custody
Custodian Integration: Partner with regulated custodians per region; define API/Webhook flows for deposit confirmations.


Off‑Chain NAV Engine: Serverless functions (AWS Lambda/Cloudflare Workers) invoke Chainlink Functions to fetch asset prices and maturity data from external bond APIs.


Attestation Module: On deposit/maturity, custodian signs an attestation; the protocol verifies via ECDSA signature and stores metadata on‑chain.


4.2 Oracle & NAV Calculation
Chainlink Functions: Primary mechanism to call external APIs for real‑time prices on bonds, equities, FX.


Aggregation Logic: Multi‑source pull (two API endpoints per asset) with median aggregation and fallback on historical reference if one source fails.


Update Cadence: NAV updated every hour on off‑chain engine; on‑chain Aggregator smart contract refreshed once per block or on mint/burn triggers.


4.3 Smart Contract Suite
Collateral Vault: Tracks total collateral commitments and available issuance capacity per sCoin.


Mint/Burn Controller:


mint(address to, uint256 amount) verifies NAV, collateralization ratio, charges fees, and mints sCoin.


burn(address from, uint256 amount) burns tokens, updates collateral usage, and emits redemption events.


Stability Module: Calculates dynamic fee rates based on:


Current collateral utilization.


Peg deviation threshold (e.g., >0.5% triggers higher fees).


AMM Pools: Pre‑deploy Uniswap/Sushiswap‑style pools for sCoin/USDC or sCoin/native token to bootstrap liquidity.


4.4 Cross‑Chain Bridge (MVP: Single Chain)
Initial Scope: Deploy all contracts on one chain (e.g., Base). Cross‑chain flows deferred.


Future Extension: Integrate Chainlink CCIP for sINR ↔ sYEN messaging; support multiple L2s or rollups; leverage same oracle layer for cross‑chain NAV consistency, through Intent based architecture. 


4.5 Compliance & Governance
Off‑Chain KYC Workflow: Bank partners complete external KYC; receive a verifiable credential; sign attestation on‑chain granting mint/burn rights.


Pseudo-Governance Model (P1):


Bootstrapped group of founding banks and protocol multisig set collateral baskets, haircuts, and initial parameters.
Upgrade path to add more signers as TVL grows.


Governance Roadmap (P2): Transition to stakeholder DAO issuing governance tokens; enable on‑chain voting on asset allowances, fee schedules, insurance vault adjustments.



5. Risk Mitigation & Guardrails
Risk Category
Mitigation
Collateral Liquidity
Over‑collateralization (120%+), buffer pool of sCoin
Custody Default
Regulated custodians, periodic attestations, insurance
Oracle Failure
Multi‑source aggregation, fallback to stale reference
Peg Drift
Dynamic fees, AMM arbitrage incentives, insurance vault
Redemption Spike
Buffer pool disburses immediately; slow redeem via bonds


Insurance Vault: Funded by stability and mint/burn fees; covers extreme shortfalls (e.g., >10% deviation).


Buffer Pool: Reserve sCoin held by protocol; auto‑funded at launch (e.g., 2% of total issuance) to smooth immediate redemptions.



6. Mock & Demo Plan
Testnet Environment:


Chain: Base / Optimism / Arbitrum for cheap and fast experience. 


Mock Collateral: ERC‑20 tokens representing bonds, corporate debt, gold.


Oracle Mocks: Chainlink mock oracles returning preset price feeds.


Attestation Simulation: Off‑chain script emits signed messages as custodial attestations.


End‑to‑End Flow:


Bank A deposits mock collateral à mint 100 sINR.


sINR transferred; recipient burns 100 sINR à triggers mint of 100 sYEN.


Recipient redeems sYEN à collateral release event.


Dashboard Prototype: Minimal frontend showing:


Collateral basket NAV.


Mint/burn UI.


Peg status indicator (oracle feed vs. on‑chain price).



7. Next Steps & Focus Areas
Buffer Pool & Insurance Vault Design: Define size, funding sources, triggers for drawdown.


Oracle Aggregation Logic: Identify API providers per region; set SLA and fallback rules.


On‑Chain KYC Flow: Draft signature schema and storage pattern for verifiable credentials.


Fee Algorithm Specification: Develop formulas for dynamic mint/burn fees based on utilization metrics.


Governance Charter: Document initial parameter‑setting process and multisig membership criteria.



our MVP will support two distinct onboarding flows:
Institutional Liquidity Providers


Who: Major banks and financial institutions (e.g. HDFC, HSBC).


Purpose: Deposit & tokenize real-world assets (sovereign/corporate bonds, equities, gold) as collateral to bootstrap the pool and earn yield.


Flow:


Off-chain KYC/AML & legal attestation (on-chain signature stored).


Custodian deposit of tokenized RWAs.


Attestation via Chainlink Functions → NAV update.


Permissioned mintStable calls to issue sXXX against their collateral.


Merchant/Payment-Gateway Onboarding


Who: Payment processors, gateways, or large merchants integrating cross-border settlements.


Purpose: Enable seamless pay-in/payout in any sXXX without holding RWAs or managing collateral.


Flow:


Simple on-chain signature verification (no deep KYC for each transaction—leveraging gateway’s existing compliance).


Gateway calls mintStable on behalf of end-user by tapping into the liquidity pool (drawing from buffer/insurance pools if needed).


Users pay in sXXX; upon receipt, gateway calls burnStable and off-ramps to local fiat.

My Question
Your Response
Thoughts
Pilot jurisdictions & licenses
“Ignore legalities for now… on-board banks via KYC, store legal info on-chain like Story Protocol.”
 Good for an MVP: defer deep legal design, but capturing KYC info on-chain is smart. Later you’ll still need to map that to actual licensing requirements per jurisdiction.
Liquidity backstop / bond maturities
Noted bonds mature → NAV redeems; but under-collateralization risk if HDFC redeems. Asked “what to do here?”
 Correct: you caught that straight bond redemption alone isn’t sufficient. We need a buffer/insurance vault or stablecoin reserve pool to handle mismatches when large redemptions occur ahead of bond cash flows.
Oracles & update frequencies
“Use Chainlink Functions to pull off-chain APIs for bonds, etc.”
 That’s exactly the role of CL Functions. Later you’ll want multi-source aggregation (e.g. two independent data providers per asset) and a fallback strategy if an API goes down.
Custodians & attestations
“Entirely custodial, permissioned—no permissionless.”
 Understood. You’ll want periodic (e.g. monthly or quarterly) attestations on-chain via Chainlink or direct audit proofs, to maintain transparency and trust.
Arbitrage incentives / stability fees
“Yes—need to peg sINR to INR at all costs; keep RWAs updated on-chain; sINR/sYEN always track forex.”
 Good call. You’ll combine mint/burn fees, small dynamic stability fees around peg deviations, and incentivized AMM arbitrage so market price stays within tight bands of INR/JPY.
Target chains / L2s
“Single chain for now; cross-chain later.”
 Simplicity first. Choose a chain with good institutional support (e.g. Polygon for low fees + easy access in India + Japan integrations).
Collateral eligibility
“Anything clients trust; any asset for yield at their own risk.”
 Ultra-flexible. You may want to categorize assets (e.g. “Tier 1” sovereign bonds vs. “Tier 2” corporates vs. “Tier 3” commodities) and apply different haircuts / over-collateralization ratios per tier.
Peg-stability guardrails (buffer, fees, insurance)
“Explain more; insurance vault is good for safety net.”
 We do need a mixed approach: – Buffer Pool: a small pool of sINR held in reserve to smooth redemptions – Dynamic Fees: adjust mint/burn fees based on liquidity stress – Insurance Vault: funded by stability fees or partner banks to cover extreme shortfalls.
Bridge design (CCIP vs. build your own)
“Use CCIP or build our own.”
 CCIP gives unified Chainlink-backed cross-chain messaging and integrates with your oracle layer, so it’s a strong candidate for MVP. Building your own is more cost/time intensive.
KYC seamlessness
“Signature, that’s it.”
We’ll need a minimal off-chain KYC workflow: banks sign an on-chain proof (e.g. a verifiable credential) that gives them permission to mint/burn. That aligns with “Signature only,” but be prepared for integration with existing banking KYC providers.
Governance model
“Bootstrapped via bank-protocol terms; later evolve to multisig/DAO.”
 That roadmap makes sense. Early on, a handful of founding banks + protocol multisig can set parameters; later open it up to a broader governance token or stakeholder DAO.

How We’ll Capture & Account for Yield
Custodian-Payout Model


Custodians hold the real-world bonds, debt or other income-bearing assets.


On maturity or at each coupon date, custodians transfer the interest proceeds into our vault’s cash reserves.


Off-Chain Yield Aggregator


A Chainlink Function (or similar off-chain worker) polls custodian APIs daily/weekly for any new interest-payments or matured principal.


It computes the net yield accrued since the last update and calls our on-chain vault contract:

 solidity
vault.recordAccruedYield(uint256 yieldAmount);


NAV Uplift


VaultManager increases its totalCollateralValue by yieldAmount.


Because share token supply remains constant, NAV per share (and thus each LP’s—and by extension each stablecoin’s—backing) increases automatically.


Optional Yield Distribution


All-in Vault Yield: Let all interest roll into collateral, passively boosting NAV.


Protocol Fee Slice: Split interest, e.g. 90% to LPs (via NAV), 10% to protocol treasury (into the insurance vault or buffer pool).


User-Facing Yield Product: If desired, we can mint a secondary “sXXX-yield” token that auto-compounds interest, mimicking Circle Yield or Aave’s aTokens.


No Gas-Heavy Rebase: We don’t need to rebase balances on every interest coupon—NAV handles it implicitly.


Transparent & Auditable: Anyone can read totalCollateralValue vs. totalShareSupply to compute yield growth.


Aligned Incentives: LPs see their share tokens appreciate, merchants always transact against a fully-backed, yield-bearing peg.



Flow
Initial Deposit & Mint


HDFC deposits ₹100 M worth of bonds → mints 100 M sINR (NAV=1).


Coupon Payment


After 1 month, bonds pay 0.5% coupon → custodian reports ₹0.5 M interest.


Off-chain worker calls vault.recordAccruedYield(500 000).


NAV Update


New totalCollateralValue = 100.5 M; totalShareSupply still 100 M.


New NAV = 1.005 INR per share → each LP’s position has grown.


Protocol Fee


If we take a 10% fee: only ₹450 000 lifts NAV; ₹50 000 moves to insurance vault.



 Merchant Perspective
Merchants using sINR/sYEN never directly “earn” yield—they pay small mint/burn fees—but the deep liquidity provided by yield-rich LPs keeps the peg tight and fees low. As the vault NAV grows, the protocol becomes more robust (bigger buffer pool, deeper insurance reserves), further tightening spreads.

 Implementation Notes
recordAccruedYield must be onlyOracle or onlyCustodian to prevent spoofing.


Accrual Cadence: Daily for high-frequency assets (commercial paper), or per coupon date for bonds.


Fee Accounting: Maintain a protocolFeeShare ratio; on each accrual, split yield between vault and insuranceVault.


Front-End: Display “APY to LPs” and “Protocol Fee” separately, so institutional partners see their net take.
